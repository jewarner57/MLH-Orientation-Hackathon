## Project Purpose
* This project was built to centralize some of the hack language resources that we found helpful as we learned hack for the first time. This project also has some information about OCaml to help any beginner wanting to get started with the language.
* This project was built for the MLH orientation hackathon for Spring 2022. This hackathon required us to use the open source language Hack in our project.

## Technologies used
* This project was built using the Hack programming language as well as HTML and CSS.
